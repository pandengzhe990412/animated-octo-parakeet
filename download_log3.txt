YouTube is blocking automated downloads. You have a few options:

1. MANUAL COOKIE EXPORT (Recommended):
   - Install the 'Get cookies.txt' extension in your browser
   - Visit YouTube and sign in
   - Export cookies to a file
   - Use: yt-dlp --cookies cookies.txt [URL]

2. Use a VPN to change your IP address

3. Wait some time and try again (rate limiting)

4. Try from a different network
